    <p>The Labrador Retriever, or just Labrador, <br>
        is a medium-large breed of retriever-gun dog. <br>
        The Labrador is the most popular breed registered of dog in Canada,<br>
        the United Kingdom, and the United States.<br><br>
    </p>

    <p>A favourite disability assistance breed in many countries, <br>
        Labradors are frequently trained to aid those with blindness or autism, <br>
        act as a therapy dog, <br>
        or perform screening and detection work for law enforcement and other official agencies.<br>
        The breed is best known for their obedience, loyalty, and playful composure. <br>
        Additionally, they are prized as sporting and hunting dogs.<br><br>
    </p>

    <p>In the 1830s, <br>
        the 10th Earl of Home and his nephews the 5th Duke of Buccleuch and Lord John Scott,<br>
        had imported progenitors of the breed from Newfoundland to Europe for use as gundogs. <br>
        Another early advocate of these Newfoundland dogs, <br>
        or Labrador Retrievers as they later became known, <br>
        was the 2nd Earl of Malmesbury who bred them for their expertise in waterfowling.<br><br>
    </p>

    <p>During the 1880s, <br>
        the 3rd Earl of Malmesbury, <br>
        the 6th Duke of Buccleuch and the 12th Earl of Home collaborated to develop and establish the modern Labrador
        breed. <br>
        The dogs Buccleuch Avon and Buccleuch Ned, <br>
        given by Malmesbury to Buccleuch, <br>
        were mated with bitches carrying blood from those originally imported by the 5th Duke and the 10th Earl of Home.
        <br>
        The offspring are considered to be the ancestors of modern Labradors.<br>
